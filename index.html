        <h2>The Game & Objective</h2>
        <p>The player is shown two random cards, face up, side by side. The player must decide 
            to bet or pass on whether the cards value is inbetween the values of the first two cards. 
            The goal is to reach 1000 credits.</p>
       </div> 
    </div>
    <div class="main-container">
        <div>
        <h2>The Ante</h2>
        <p>Once the first two cards are dealt the player chooses whether they wish to be dealt 
            the hit card. For example, if the first two cards are consecutive then there is no 
            card in-between and so the player passes and two more cards are dealt, the same if 
            the first two cards are equal in value. For this reason the player pays 5 credits 
            only when the initial two cards are one or more values apart, this way the player 
            has a chance but also cannot continue to hold their bet until they are dealt an ace 
            and a 2 which will guarantee a win. Therefore, the player plays 5 credits ante to the 
            pot each time that a playable set of cards are dealt.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>The Bet</h2>
        <p>The bet will then commence once a set of playable cards are dealt and the player puts 
            5 credits to the pot, then the hit card is placed face down and the player chooses 
            whether to either pass, double, triple, quadruple etc players bet on the premise that 
            the hit card is in-between the dealers cards. The player can only bet with the credits 
            they have. If the hit card is not between the dealers cards then the player loses the bet. 
            If the hit card is the same value as either of the dealers cards then again the player loses 
            the bet as it is not in-between. If the card is in-between, then the player wins the pot 
            and play continues from the beginning. The player wins the game outright if they reach 1000 credits.</p>
