        <h2>The Game & Objective</h2>
        <p>The player is shown two random cards, face up, side by side. The player must decide 
            to bet or pass on whether the cards value is inbetween the values of the first two cards. 
            The goal is to reach 1000 credits.</p>
       </div> 
    </div>
    <div class="main-container">
        <div>
        <h2>The Ante</h2>
        <p>Once the first two cards are dealt the player chooses whether they wish to be dealt 
            the hit card.</p>
           <ol> 
            <li>If the two dealer cards are consecutive or equal in value then there is clearly 
                no card in-between and so the player can pass and two more cards are dealt.</li>
            <li>If either of these scenarios occur then the player only pays 5 credits 
                when the initial two cards are one or more apart in value, this way the player 
                has a chance but also cannot continue to hold their bet until they are dealt cards 
                that guarantee a win.</li>
            <li>The player gives 5 credits ante to the pot each time that a playable set of cards are dealt.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>The Bet</h2>
        <p>The bet will then commence once a set of playable cards are dealt. </p> 
            <ol>
                <li> The player automatically pays the 5 credits ante to the pot, then the hit card is 
                placed face down and the player chooses whether to either pass or bet.</li>
                <li> The player bets on the premise that the hit card has a value in-between the dealers cards values.</li>
                <li> The player can only bet with the credits they have. </li>
                <li> If the hit card is not between the dealers cards then the player loses the bet, this 
                includes cards equal in value. </li>
                <li> If the card is in-between, then the player wins the pot and play continues from the beginning. </li>
                <li> The player wins the game outright if they reach 1000 credits.</li>
            </ol>
