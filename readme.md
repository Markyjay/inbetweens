# Inbetweens Card Game

Welcome to Inbetweens the Card Game! Test your luck by placing bets on whether the next card will be "inbetween"

Inbetween is a card game I played as a teenager, it’s a betting game usually played for money. The game will be adapted for the purposes of this project. As a teacher I used to play games like this with my students using tokens to get them to understand the concept of probability and chance and my students found it very enjoyable and learned quickly to ascertain high and low probabilities and the highs and lows of risk-taking. 


## The game
The dealer lays two random cards in face up side by side and in front of the player, so both dealer and player can see the value of each card, a third card is then laid face down in-between these cards and play begins.
## Rank of cards
A(high), K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
## Game objective
To reach 1000 credits.
## The Ante
Once the first two cards are dealt the player chooses whether they wish to be dealt the hit card. For example, if the first two cards are consecutive then there is no card in-between and so the player passes and two more cards are dealt, the same if the first two cards are equal in value. For this reason the player pays 5 credits only when the initial two cards are one or more values apart, This way the player has a chance but also cannot continue to hold their bet until they are dealt an ace and a 2 which will guarantee a win. Therefore, the player plays 5 credits ante to the pot each time that a playable set of cards are dealt.

## The Bet
The bet will then commence once a set of playable cards are dealt and the player puts 5 credits to the pot, then the hit card is placed face down and the player chooses whether to either pass, double, triple, quadruple etc their bet on the premise that the hit card is in-between the dealers cards. The player can only bet with the credits they have.

If the hit card is not between the dealers cards then the player loses his or her bet. If the hit card is the same value as either of the dealers cards then again the player loses the bet as it is not in-between. If the card is in-between, then the player wins the pot and play continues from the beginning. The player wins the game outright if they reach 1000 credits.

## Adaptations for project purposes
1.	The game can be played with multiple players but as this is my first time creating a game using JavaScript I will keep it to a single player and the dealer. It may be something to expand upon once I improve my skills in coding. 
2.	They winner is usually the player with the most amount of chips at the end of the game or the game can end when player lose everything to the dealer.
3.	If the two dealer cards that are laid are consecutive then the dealer must lay two new cards as the player zero chance of a card being inbetween, if the dealer cards are the same in value then the player says split and the dealer must lay a card on the first card on which the player can choose to bet or pass and then lay another card on the second card where the player can choose to bet or pass. (This rule will be removed due to technical difficulties but may be able to be applied in future iterations of the game) 
4.	The betting is usually done by choosing a specific amount to bet, if the player gets an ace and a 2 they usually bet the pot as it’s the highest chance of a win. If an ace or 2 comes for their hit card they lose and so lose the amount of credits equal to the pot. If the card is inbetween the ace and 2 then they win everything in the pot.
